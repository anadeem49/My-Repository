3130A1: This assignment entailed reading a text file into an array and sorting it via bubble sort. Then the sorted data in the         array was fed to the linked list.

3130A2: This assignment entailed processing songs from an array of text files and sending them to a linked list, which would           serve as data entries for the array-implemented Queue, which merges the multiple file entries and the array-                   implemented Stack, which returns the last song in the merged entries.

3130A3: This assignment entailed using BinaryTrees to print out the movie titles and corresponding release years. And finally,
        the assignment asked for the subsets of the text file with the any start and end values for the desired subsets.
        
3130A4: This assignment entailed using a HashMap to print out the movie title and its corresponding genre. Then the assignment         asked for the number of movies per genre AND the number of movies per given year (preferably within the last five).
