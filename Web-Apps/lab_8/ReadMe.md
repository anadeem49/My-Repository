This project demonstrates the creation of a basic and a fully functional calculator. It has all of the basic functionalities of a website calculator, such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, all clear and delete. These operations can be performed on both integers and decimals. This project was completed with the help of HTML, CSS and (vanilla) Javascript. I referred to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&t=140s for inspiration and help.
