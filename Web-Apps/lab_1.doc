CISC 3140: Lab 1
Due 17 February

I was assigned to Group 1, which included 20 people whose first names were between A and I, inclusive. We hypothetically decided to create a flash game. To create the game, we will split into four groups: frontend, backend, UX/UI, & QA. We were on a Zoom call after the lecture and we brainstormed for 10 to 15 minutes about what we want the project to be.

The end product will be a flash game similar to Among Us and Club Penguin called Mareeo Shooting With Them. The game will identify as 2D, a platform shooter game, a text based adventure game, and free with microtransactions. The game will be composed of sprites, character models, a plot, power rankings, UI/UX, QA, and online and multiplayer.

Multiple product ideas came together as one through compromise and unanimity. As the team captain began to shape the conversation regarding what our possible project could entail, ideas started to come about and the project was deemed promising and doable. As a result, the final result was one influenced by my team’s individual efforts.

To talk about my team’s dynamics, I would say that my team had a coherent and fluent communication. All of us had something to contribute through questions, suggestions, and the like.

My team did split into smaller groups, based on each person’s choice of their tech stack.This choice of development helped lower the learning curve and each person can easily contribute to the codebase with their choice of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.

Since the Zoom call after the lecture, our plan of action has not changed. It is based on the team captain’s writeup of the project we came to agree on. I have sent you the invite to my team’s document. The plan for now seems solid, unless other group members want to improve.

To describe the process my team (and its subteams) went through to define the overall project idea, we first went into the Zoom breakout room for team 1 and just started chatting to get a sense of everyone’s participation and their devotion to the project at hand. We brainstormed out loud for 15 or so minutes and the group’s team captain laid out the foundations for our project on a separate Google docs. In there, we added the tech stacks we were all proficient in and comfortable with.

I feel that splitting into a subteam definitely facilitated collaboration and communication. As I do this lab, I feel optimistic that my group and I will do our utmost best to put in the time and effort needed to do well in this forthcoming project.

Yes, my group and I decided on and fully described the expectant outcomes of our project. To sum it up, we will create a flash game (“browser game”) influenced by Among Us and Club Penguin called Mareeo Shooting With Them whose features are described in the Google Doc shared with you earlier. Our dev teams will entail frontend, backend, QA and UI/UX.

What worked was our project related communications and plans. Our project is sufficiently narrated in the doc and we are well aware of our strengths which will determine our specific roles in the project.

Working collaboratively fosters more group member interactions. In a group, each person knows what the other is doing and can easily seek assistance. Working individually is the exact opposite. There is a very small window for communication, if it exists. Each person is on his/her own. They seek guidance via Google instead of their peers.

As mentioned above, the benefits of collaboration is that it facilitates peer to peer communication. Collaboration breaks down large tasks into small, manageable subtasks, which can be completed in a shorter period of time. On the other hand, collaboration can hinder individual creativity.
